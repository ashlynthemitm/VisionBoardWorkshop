      <p>Welcome! This is my vision board which includes many goals and aspirations! I am a passionate senior Computer Science and Sociology student with a concentration in Data Science. I am dedicated to technology and interested in advocating for inclusivity through my research. I aspire to pursue a Ph.D. because I am interested in applying computational methods to communities affected by social inequities. My research interests broadly include Human-Centered AI, Computational Social Science, and Societal Computing.  I aspire to leverage data science methods to tackle disparities in minority access to vital resources, such as mobility, to more equitable futures through information and education. With technology evolving rapidly and societal challenges arising from information inequity, I aspire to delve into the development of solutions to bridge this information gap.</p>
